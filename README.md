### <a name="Ontology-did"></a>Ontology DID <sup>[top⇈](#ontology-infrastructure)</sup>
> Ontology DID (also known as ONT ID) is a decentralized identification protocol which is based on the W3C DID specifications. It supports collaborative services such as distributed and diversified ownership confirmation, identification, and authentication of various entities including individuals, legal entities, objects, and contents. Ontology DID establishes a cryptographically-based digital identity for each entity, allowing self-sovereignty of data authorization and ownership confirmation, which makes the identity and data, assets that the user can control.

### <a name="Ontology-java-sdk"></a>Ontology Java SDK <sup>[top⇈](#ontology-infrastructure)</sup>
> This is a comprehensive Java library for the Ontology blockchain. Currently, it supports local wallet management, digital identity management, digital asset management, deployment and invoke for Smart Contract, and communication with Ontology Blockchain. In the future it will support more rich functions and applications.

### <a name="Ontology-python-sdk"></a>Ontology Python SDK <sup>[top⇈](#ontology-infrastructure)</sup>
> Ontology Python SDK contains five key features: an RPC interface, wallet management, digital asset management, identity management and smart contract support. The RPC interface can interact with the Ontology blockchain - including querying and sending transactions. The SDK can manages wallet files and store encrypted private keys of the asset account and identity. It can transfer ONT/ONG, check an account balance, withdraw ONT/ONG and so on. Its identity management functionality can send requests to register an Ontology DID and can receive DDO objects. The Python SDK also support constructing, deploying, and invoking a smart contract.
