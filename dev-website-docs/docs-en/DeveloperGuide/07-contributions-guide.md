<p align="center" class="version">Version 1.0.1 </p> 

## Introduction

Dear Contributors,

This is a guide to help you become part of the Ontology technical community.

We encourage the community to form independent groups so that we, the Ontology Foundation, can engage on a strategic level for support and rewards. Itâ€™s important for us that the different community participants takes responsibility for their own development and management - they are a cornerstone in the Ontology ecosystem and help define it!

<h4 align="center">The Ontology Foundation puts the technical community at highest priority and has allocated 10% (100,000,000 ONT) of the total token supply to the technical community alone</h4>

How you chose to structure an independent group, join another groups, or work as an individual contributor is entirely up to yourself. 

For new groups, welcome you to send proposals to: mathiasglintborg@ont.io and include e.g. structure of group, team, budget and initiatives.

To join an existing Ontology contributor group, talk to us at [Ontology Discord](https://discord.gg/9zcTQNy) or meet the independent groups at [Ontology Community Developers](https://discord.gg/YWXB9kj).

If you are independent contributor, talk to us at [Ontology Discord](https://discord.gg/9zcTQNy) and check out the [Developer Center](https://developer.ont.io/).

## Technical contributions

The main point of entrance to the technical community is [Developer Center](https://developer.ont.io/).

Generally, we divide coding and development from the technical community into three categories:

- [Bounty program](https://bounty.ont.io/)
  - You can claim existing bounties or suggest your own
- [dApps](https://dapp.ont.io/)
  - We welcome dApp projects to build on Ontology, talk to our VC, or incubation service
- [Ontology enhancement proposals (OEP)](https://github.com/ontio/OEPs)
  - OEPs describe standards for the Ontology platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards

### Rewards

Rewards for qualified contributions are made according to the standard process for community contributions. It will be based on case-by-case evaluation conducted by the Ontology Foundation and Ontology Research Institute. 

### Developer community organizational cooperation

The Ontology Council welcomes organizations to discuss [cooperation](https://info.ont.io/cooperation/en). Please indicate that you are requesting technical community cooperation when you apply. The Ontology Council will carry out reviews based on the proposal, code contributions, and weekly reviews (JIRA will be used for management). Incentives will be distributed to partner institutions on a regular basis. Particularly excellent organizations can be considered for investment from Ontology.
