DAPI is API for dApps on Ontology blockchain. This is an implementation of dAPI from [OEP-6](https://github.com/backslash47/OEPs/blob/oep-dapp-api/OEP-6/OEP-6.mediawiki) communication protocol.

It is necessary to have installed suitable **dAPI provider** . Reference implementation is [Cyano Wallet](https://github.com/OntologyCommunityDevelopers/cyano-wallet).

The library is written in TypeScript, so all the methods and objects are typed. It is therefore usable in TypeScript projects as well as vanilla JavaScript projects.
