[SmartX]((http://smartx.ont.io/#/)) is a one-stop IDE that can be used to compile, deploy, and invoke smart contracts. It provides a range of smart contract templates and a powerful online editor. In the future, smart contract developers will be able to trade smart contracts they write and collaborate with others to develop a smart contract.

In the future, SmartX will work like GitHub to be a distributed software project hosting platform. It will support multiple people to participate in and share a complex contract, and at the time same, implement a set of economic incentives and integrate fair governance policies to reflect the contributions of each participant, which will encourage smart contract writing, transaction, collaboration, community building, and the development of a valuable smart contract ecosystem.
